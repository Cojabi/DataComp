Application examples
====================
Example notebooks showcasing simple Datacomp workflows and results on simulated data can be found at DataComp_Examples_:.
A reference to a more thorough application example on real world data will be provided in the future. \
Manuscript in preparation.

.. _DataComp_Examples:

- `Cross-sectional Comparison Example`_

In this example a cross-sectional comparison is performed in which only data at one point in time (here at baseline) is
considered.

- `Longitudinal Comparison Example`_

The longitudinal examples shows a comparison of the data distribution at each time point in a intra-entity normalized
and unnormalized fashion.
