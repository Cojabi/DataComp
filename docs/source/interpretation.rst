Statistical Comparison Result-Table
-----------------------------------

The index (rows) of the result table consists of the feature name on the outer level and the dataset combination used \
for the comparison as second level index.
FEATURE1 (1, 2) means, that this row represents the comparison of FEATURE1 between dataset 1 and 2, where 1 and 2 \
points to the position in the DataCollection.

The result table of a feature comparison lists in the columns:
- the p-values
- the familywise error corrected p-values
- a boolean if the test resutl was statistically significant
- one column for each dataframe listing the number of observations for that feature
